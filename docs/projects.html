						<p>Tools: <i>Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn, time</i></p>
						<p> I have built a machine-learning classification model to make a prediction for the weather, whether it rains or not tomorrow. I have worked with the data from Australia in order to run the model and get results. I have checked accuracy scores and computation time of various models to find the best model that fits the data, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (see <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/muratko357/Weather-prediction/blob/main/Weather%20prediction.ipynb">codes</a>).</p></td>

						<big>LendingClub Analysis: Predicting Payments</big>
						<p>Tools: <i>Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn</i></p>
						<p>Via data visualization, I have conducted an exploratory data analysis on the loan data of LendingClub. Then I have applied Random Forest and Decision Tree models of machine learning to predict whether a particular loan would be paid back in full. The model has included variables related to customers, e.g., purpose of the loan, interest rate of the loan, monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded, income of the borrower, debt-to-income ratio, FICO credit score of the borrower, number of days the borrower has had a credit line, and so on (see the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/muratko357/ML_models/blob/master/Decision_Tree_and_Random-Forests_Project.ipynb">codes </a>).</p></td>

						<p>Tools: <i>Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, tensorflow</i></p>
						<p>I have used the Bank Authentication Data Set of UCI and a Deep Neural Network Classifier to predict if a bank note is authentic or not. The data consists of 5 varibales: variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), entropy of image (continuous), and class (integer) indicating whether or not a bank note was authentic (see the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/muratko357/ML_models/blob/master/banknote-authentication.ipynb">codes</a>).</p></td>

						<p>Using data visulation tools and crosstabulation, I have analyzed the data that covers the number of Uber pickup calls in April 2014 in New York.

						<p>Tool: <i>Tableau</i></p>
						<p>I have completed various tasks in order to answer business questions in relation to sales, profits, and shipment status of orders. For this purpose, I have created various dashboards using crosstables, graphics, and maps in which I applied design principles of data visualization (see the <a target="_blank" href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/murat.kocak">dashboards</a>).</p></td>

						<p>Tool: <i>ArcGIS</i></p>
						<p>The data for California 2012 electoral politics involves geographic information as well as numbers of votes in favor of genetically modified organisms-GMOs in food and total voters specific to geographical locations. I have a created a map that displays a normalized distribution of 'yes' votes by county in the California state. I have created a PDF format of the mapâ€™s layout (see the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f9c87a2f5c3647e3b86e89364d10a4f4">map package</a>).</p></td>

						<p>I have conducted exploratory analyses on violent and sexual crime across municipalities of the Netherlands and neighborhoods of the Amsterdam city. Using libraries of Python, I have created a static choropleth and its interactive version (see the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/muratko357/Netherlands-Crime-Analysis">codes</a>).

						<p>Tools: <i>Python, pandas, BeautifulSoup, nltk, re, threading, time</i></p>
						<p>In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the graduation of Data Science & Machine Learning Course, I have completed the part II of the project and created an automatic web-scraping and text summarization tool through using Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques. The authomatic tool collects and processes official reports and statements about COVID-19 from official sources and summarizes them. In addition, it collects and updates readily available summaries of COVID-19 news from the media. The goal of the tool is to enable public to easily follow official advices, reports, and news on this matter (see the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/muratko357/NLP_coronavirus_project">codes</a>).</p></td>

						<p>Tools: <i>Python, numpy, pandas, os, sys, scipy, imageio, matplotlib, tersorflow, pprint</i></p>
						<p>I have implemented the Neural Style Transfer(NST) NST algoritm to generate a novel artistic image of the Louvre museum in Paris in the style of a painting by Claude Monet. The algoritm uses a previously trained 19-layer version of the VGG network. Therefore, the network model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and thus has learned to recognize a variety of low level features (at the shallower layers) and high level features (at the deeper layers). The algoritm of this project has successfully transferred this learning (see the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/muratko357/Building_Convolutional_Neural_Networks/blob/master/Art_Generation_with_Neural_Style_Transfe.ipynb"/>codes</a>).</p></td>

						<p>Tools: <i>Python, numpy, argparse, os, matplotlib, scipy, PIL, tensorflow, keras, yolo utilities provided by deeplearning.ai</i></p>
						<p>I have applied the You Only Look Once-YOLO model to car detection on a car detection dataset. The project uses pre-trained weights since the YOLO model is very computationally expensive to train. On the other hand, YOLO is a popular algorithm with its high accuracy and being able to run in real-time as it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions (see the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/muratko357/Building_Convolutional_Neural_Networks/blob/master/Autonomous_driving_application_Car_detection.ipynb"/>codes</a>).</p></td>

						<p>Tools: <i>Python, numpy, pandas, keras, tensorflow, cv2, os, utilities provided by deeplearning.ai</i></p>
						<p>I have implemented the triplet loss function, using a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings and using these encodings to perform face verification and recognition tasks. Face Verification is used in applications to verify the identity of a specific person, e.g., face-verification security-systems of smart phones, while Face Recognition can tell who this person is through searching databases (see the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/muratko357/Building_Convolutional_Neural_Networks/blob/master/Face_Recognition.ipynb"/>codes</a>).</p></td>
