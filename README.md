## Projects

In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the graduation of Data Science & Machine Learning Course, I have completed the part II of the project and created an automatic web-scraping and text summarization tool through using Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques, the Python Programming language and related libraries. The tool collects and processes some official reports and statements about COVID-19 from publicly available sources and summarizes them. In addition, it gives summaries of news provided by news web-sites and automatically and daily updates all these outputs. The goal of the tool is to provide advice for public and enable them to easily follow news and important issues around the pandemic (for the whole project, see [humanitariandata.co](https://humanitariandata.co/))

I have learned about Neural Style Transfer(NST) and implemented the NST algoritm; and the algoritm has generated a novel artistic image of the Louvre museum in Paris in the style of a painting by Claude Monet. The algoritm uses a previously trained convolutional network, namely a 19-layer version of the VGG network. The network model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and thus has learned to recognize a variety of low level features (at the shallower layers) and high level features (at the deeper layers). So, the algoritm of this project has successfully transferred this learning for the puropose of this project.

I have learned the You Only Look Once-YOLO model and apply it to car detection on a car detection dataset. Because the YOLO model is very computationally expensive to train, the project uses pre-trained weights. YOLO is a popular algorithm with its high accuracy and being able to run in real-time as it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions.

I have implemented the triplet loss function, using a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings and using these encodings to perform face verification and recognition tasks. Face Verification is used in applications to verify the identity of a specific person, e.g., face-verification security-systems of smart phones, while Face Recognition can tell who this person is through searching databases.

<img align="left" width="250" height="140" src="Images/LendingClub project.png">**[LendingClub Project](https://github.com/muratko357/ML_models/blob/master/Decision_Tree_and_Random-Forests_Project.ipynb)**

Via data visualization, I have conducted an exploratory data analysis on the loan data of LendingClub. Then I have applied Random Forest and Decision Tree models of machine learning to predict whether a particular loan would be paid back in full. The model has included variables related to the customer, e.g., whether the borrower meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, purpose of the loan, interest rate of the loan, monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded, income of the borrower, debt-to-income ratio, FICO credit score of the borrower, number of days the borrower has had a credit line, and so on.

<img align="left" width="250" height="140" src="Images/banknote-authentication.jpeg">**[Bank Note Authentication](https://github.com/muratko357/ML_models/blob/master/banknote-authentication.ipynb)**

I have used the [Bank Authentication Data Set of UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication) and a Deep Neural Network Classifier to predict if a Bank Note is authentic or not. The data consists of 5 varibales: variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), entropy of image (continuous), and class (integer) indicating whether or not a Bank Note was authentic. 

<img align="left" width="250" height="140" src="Images/rain.jpg"> **[Weather Prediction](https://github.com/muratko357/Weather-prediction/blob/main/Weather%20prediction.ipynb)**

I have built a machine-learning classification model to make a prediction for the weather, whether it rains or not tomorrow. I have worked with the data from Australia in order to run the model and get results. I have checked accuracy scores and computation time of various models to find the best model that fits the data, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

<img align="left" width="250" height="140" src="Images/Uber data analysis.png"> **[Uber Data Analysis](https://github.com/muratko357/Uber-data-analysis/blob/main/Uber_data_anaylsis.ipynb)**

Using data visulation tools and crosstabulation, I have analyzed the data that covers the number of Uber pickup calls in April 2014 in New York. Findings of the analysis gives important information based on the geographic location and the time of the calls.

<img align="left" width="250" height="140" src="Images/San Francisco Crime Map.png"> **[San Francisco Crime Data Analysis](https://github.com/muratko357/San-Francisco-Crime-Data-Analysis)**

I have conducted an exploratory data analysis on the 2016 crime dataset of San Francisco through using data visualization tools, crosstabulation and crime mapping. The map displays the crime rates of the districts of the city.
