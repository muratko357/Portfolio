## Projects
### 1. Data Analysis and Business Intelligence (BI) Projects
 
#### [1.1. Mapping and Analyzing Security Incidents to Enhance the Safety of Humanitarian Aid Workers in High-Risk Areas](https://github.com/muratko357/Aid-worker-security-incidents-analysis)

_Tools: Power BI, DAX, M, Python, GeoPy, Pandas, QGIS, Mapshaper_

This project aims to enhance the safety of humanitarian aid workers by analyzing security incidents in which they were killed, wounded, or kidnapped from 1997 to 2024. Deliverables include a two-page interactive Power BI dashboard and a complementary QGIS map visualization (PNG). These tools provide actionable insights into incident patterns, victim demographics, organizational involvement, and geographic hotspots. By integrating advanced data modeling, geospatial analysis, and dynamic visualizations, the project empowers security managers, analysts, and humanitarian organizations to make informed strategic and operational decisions in high-risk areas.

#### 1.1.1. Key Features

_**a) Interactive Power BI Dashboard**_
<br clear="left"/>
**Global Overview (1997â€“2024):** A dynamic visualization showcasing global trends in security incidents. This page uses bubble maps to plot incident locations by latitude and longitude, where bubble size and color represent the severity of victim counts (aid workers). Users can interactively filter incidents by year, organization, casualty type, and demographic variables to gain a high-level understanding of patterns worldwide.

**East Mediterranean Humanitarian Corridor (2012â€“2024):** A detailed analysis of provincial-level incidents within the East Mediterranean region (Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria). This page leverages custom shape maps, enriched with victim count data at the province level. Interactive slicers provide insights tailored to specific humanitarian organizations and casualty types, enabling decision-makers to focus on regional challenges.

<br/>

_**b) Custom QGIS Map Visualization**_
<br clear="left"/>
The custom QGIS map visualization for the East Mediterranean Humanitarian Corridor uses data points derived from latitude and longitude to map incidents at the provincial level. Attack types are symbolized for clarity, while labels highlight functional locations impacted by incidents, such as office, organization compound, and project site. The mapâ€™s layers were standardized and aligned for accurate analysis and layout.

#### 1.1.2. Data Sources and Preparation

_**a) Primary Dataset:**_
<br/>
Aid Worker Security Incident-level Data from 1997â€“2024, including victim demographics, casualty types, and organizational affiliations. Source: Aid Worker Security Database.

_**b) Geographic Data:**_
<br/>
Shapefiles for Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria downloaded from GADM, standardized using QGIS, and converted to TopoJSON for seamless Power BI integration.

_**c) Data Cleaning and Transformation:**_

**Python for Reverse Geocoding:** Missing geographic details were imputed using latitude and longitude.

**Power Query for Standardization:** Adjusted geographic names (e.g., "Deir ez-Zor" â†’ "Dayr Az Zawr") and addressed inconsistencies across datasets.

#### 1.1.3. Technical Highlights

_**a) Advanced Power BI Features:**_

**Dynamic Measure - Victim Count:** Calculates the total number of victims, dynamically adjusting based on slicer selections such as date, country, attack type, casualty type, organization, functional location, gender, and more.

**Dynamic Measure - Incident Count:** Calculates the total number of distinct incidents similarly.

**Dynamic Map Titles:** Titles adapt based on slicer selections for contextual relevance.

**Custom Shape Maps:** Merged shapefiles enriched Power BI visuals with region-specific insights.

_**b) Relationships and Filtering Logic:**_

**Bridge Table:** Addressed many-to-many relationships between organizations and casualty types for accurate cross-filtering.

**Temporal Filtering:** Calendar table enables trends by year, month, and week.

_**c) Geospatial Integration:**_

**QGIS and MapShaper:** Custom province-level maps required shapefile standardization and projection alignment (EPSG:4326).

**Interactive Power BI Maps:** Bubble maps for global and regional analyses are responsive to user-selected filters.

#### 1.1.4. Impact and Future Enhancements
This project enables humanitarian actors to enhance resource allocation, risk assessment, and policy development by leveraging data analytics and GIS.

Future Plans: Introduce filters for Actor Type (primary instigator group responsible for the event) and Motive to deepen insights. Optimize DAX measures and integrate real-time data for enhanced responsiveness.

_Note: The data points indicating incident locations are approximate rather than exact, due to the imputation of missing values in the latitude and longitude columns._

<img align="left" width="250" height="160"  alt="Inventory Dashboard" style="margin: 0 10px 0 0;" src="Images/Inventory%20dashboard.png"/> 

_Tools: Power BI, DAX_

This dashboard leverages the power of Power BI and DAX to provide actionable insights into inventory performance and optimization. By analyzing historical sales data and demand patterns, the dashboard enables businesses to streamline stock management, reduce costs, and make informed decisions to maintain optimal inventory levels. Key features include:

#### ABC and XYZ Analysis:
The dashboard segments products by their revenue contribution (ABC classification) and demand consistency (XYZ classification), allowing businesses to focus on high-priority items with reliable or unpredictable demand patterns.

#### Reorder Optimization:
Using dynamic calculations, the dashboard identifies when stock should be replenished based on historical sales data, lead times, and supplier delivery intervals. This helps maintain optimal stock levels, reducing both excess inventory and stockouts.

#### Inventory Turnover Insights:
The Inventory Turnover Ratio helps monitor the frequency with which inventory is sold and replenished, providing critical data to improve stock movement and overall supply chain performance.

#### Sales and Demand Trends:
By analyzing historical sales trends, the dashboard supports better forecasting and inventory planning, ensuring that stock levels are aligned with actual market demand.

#### Impact and Future Enhancements:
This dashboard is a practical tool for improving inventory management, focusing on key areas such as ABC and XYZ classification, inventory turnover analysis, and reorder optimization. Its current functionality, based on historical data, can be further enhanced by refining reorder optimization to include profit margins and machine learning-based demand forecasting. By empowering businesses to make informed, data-driven decisions, the dashboard enhances operational efficiency, aligns stock levels with market demands, and supports a more strategic approach to inventory management.
