## Projects

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="Images/NL_crime_rates.png"> **[Netherlands Crime Analysis](https://github.com/muratko357/Netherlands-Crime-Analysis)**

The study conducts an exploratory data analysis on Violent and Sexual Crime rates-VSC (per 1000 inhabitants) by municipality in the Netherlands. The data is sourced by Statistics Netherlands and published under the name of "Registered crimes: districts and neighborhoods 2018," This analyis produces a table for top 20 municipalities with the highest VSC rates and a thematic map of the Netherlands displaying the municipilaties and coloring them based on thier crime rates, which enables to make comparisons among them.

In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the graduation of Data Science & Machine Learning Course, I have completed the part II of the project and created an automatic web-scraping and text summarization tool through using Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques. The tool collects and processes some official reports and statements about COVID-19 from publicly available sources and summarizes them. In addition, it collects summaries of news and daily updates all these outputs. The goal of the tool is to enable public to easily follow official advices, reports, and news around the pandemic (for the whole project, see [humanitariandata.co](https://humanitariandata.co/)).

<img align="left" width="250" height="140" src="Images/generated_image.jpg"> **[Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/muratko357/Building_Convolutional_Neural_Networks/blob/master/Art_Generation_with_Neural_Style_Transfe.ipynb)**

I have implemented the Neural Style Transfer(NST) NST algoritm to generate a novel artistic image of the Louvre museum in Paris in the style of a painting by Claude Monet. The algoritm uses a previously trained 19-layer version of the VGG network. Therefore, the network model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and thus has learned to recognize a variety of low level features (at the shallower layers) and high level features (at the deeper layers). The algoritm of this project has successfully transferred this learning for the puropose of this project.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="Images/car detection.png"> **[Car Detection for Autonomous Driving Application](https://github.com/muratko357/Building_Convolutional_Neural_Networks/blob/master/Autonomous_driving_application_Car_detection.ipynb)**

I have applied the You Only Look Once-YOLO model to car detection on a car detection dataset. The project uses pre-trained weights since the YOLO model is very computationally expensive to train. ON the other hand, YOLO is a popular algorithm with its high accuracy and being able to run in real-time as it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions.

<img align="left" width="250" height="140" src="Images/distance_kiank.png"> **[Face Verification & Face Recognition](https://github.com/muratko357/Building_Convolutional_Neural_Networks/blob/master/Face_Recognition.ipynb)**

I have implemented the triplet loss function, using a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings and using these encodings to perform face verification and recognition tasks. Face Verification is used in applications to verify the identity of a specific person, e.g., face-verification security-systems of smart phones, while Face Recognition can tell who this person is through searching databases.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="Images/LendingClub project.png">**[LendingClub Project](https://github.com/muratko357/ML_models/blob/master/Decision_Tree_and_Random-Forests_Project.ipynb)**

Via data visualization, I have conducted an exploratory data analysis on the loan data of LendingClub. Then I have applied Random Forest and Decision Tree models of machine learning to predict whether a particular loan would be paid back in full. The model has included variables related to customers, e.g., whether the borrower meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, purpose of the loan, interest rate of the loan, monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded, income of the borrower, debt-to-income ratio, FICO credit score of the borrower, number of days the borrower has had a credit line, and so on.

<img align="left" width="250" height="140" src="Images/banknote-authentication.jpeg">**[Bank Note Authentication](https://github.com/muratko357/ML_models/blob/master/banknote-authentication.ipynb)**

I have used the [Bank Authentication Data Set of UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication) and a Deep Neural Network Classifier to predict if a Bank Note is authentic or not. The data consists of 5 varibales: variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), entropy of image (continuous), and class (integer) indicating whether or not a Bank Note was authentic. 

<img align="left" width="250" height="140" src="Images/rain.jpg"> **[Weather Prediction](https://github.com/muratko357/Weather-prediction/blob/main/Weather%20prediction.ipynb)**

I have built a machine-learning classification model to make a prediction for the weather, whether it rains or not tomorrow. I have worked with the data from Australia in order to run the model and get results. I have checked accuracy scores and computation time of various models to find the best model that fits the data, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

<img align="left" width="250" height="140" src="Images/Uber data analysis.png"> **[New York Uber Data Analysis](https://github.com/muratko357/Uber-data-analysis/blob/main/Uber_data_anaylsis.ipynb)**

Using data visulation tools and crosstabulation, I have analyzed the data that covers the number of Uber pickup calls in April 2014 in New York. Findings of the analysis gives important information for the business and drivers based on the geographic location and the time of the calls.

<img align="left" width="250" height="140" src="Images/San Francisco Crime Map.png"> **[San Francisco Crime Data Analysis](https://github.com/muratko357/San-Francisco-Crime-Data-Analysis)**

I have conducted an exploratory data analysis on the 2016 crime dataset of San Francisco through using data visualization tools, crosstabulation and crime mapping. The map displays the crime rates of the districts of the city.
