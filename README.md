### **[Rule of Law Dashboard: A Historical Comparison of Countries' Performances 1789-2023](Rule_of_Law-Compare_Country-Performances_By_Year.pbix)**

<img align="left" width="250" height="160"  alt="Inventory Dashboard" style="margin: 0 10px 0 0;" src="Images/Rule_of_Law_Dashboard.png"/> 

_Tools: Power BI, DAX_

This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the Rule of Law Index and related indicators from 1789 to 2023, offering insights into governance standards across various nations, with a focus on EU members and candidate countries. In order to enrich the dataset, I added calculated columns for Geographic Regions, EU Candidates, and EU Membership Status based on historical data, allowing users to explore trends within specific regional contexts and EU expansion over time. Key features include:

**Historical Trends Analysis:** Visualizes the evolution of governance indicators, such as access to justice and judicial independence, enabling users to track trends over centuries. EU expansion is highlighted with dynamically updated information as users hover over specific years.

**Dynamic Indicator Calculations:** The dashboard employs advanced DAX formulas to allow users to select indicators and dynamically update the visualizations, providing indicator-specific insights tailored to user preferences.

**Country Comparisons:** Users can select individual countries or regions, such as Europe or EU candidates, to compare rule of law performance. A bar chart ranks countries based on their most recent scores, offering a quick visual comparison across selected nations.

**Country-Specific Ranking and Score Analysis:** On drill-through pages, users can view each selected country’s historical score and ranking for each Rule of Law indicator by year, enabling detailed, year-over-year comparisons within a global context.

**Interactive Tooltips and Descriptions:** Tooltips and dynamic text boxes provide definitions and detailed explanations for each indicator, alongside contextual information from the dataset codebook and relevant academic references.

### **[Inventory Management Dashboard](inventory_management_dashboard.pbix)**

<img align="left" width="250" height="160"  alt="Inventory Dashboard" style="margin: 0 10px 0 0;" src="Images/Inventory%20dashboard.png"/> 

_Tools: Power BI, DAX_

This Inventory Management Dashboard enables data-driven decision making to enhance supply chain efficiency, showcasing advanced Power BI visualizations and DAX formulas. Key features include:

**ABC and XYZ Analysis:** The dashboard segments products by their revenue contribution (ABC classification) and demand consistency (XYZ classification), allowing businesses to focus on high-priority items with reliable or unpredictable demand patterns.

**Reorder Optimization:** Using dynamic calculations, the dashboard identifies when stock should be replenished based on historical sales data, lead times, and supplier delivery intervals. This helps maintain optimal stock levels, reducing both excess inventory and stockouts.

**Inventory Turnover Insights:** The Inventory Turnover Ratio helps monitor the frequency with which inventory is sold and replenished, providing critical data to improve stock movement and overall supply chain performance.

**Sales and Demand Trends:** By analyzing historical sales trends, the dashboard supports better forecasting and inventory planning, ensuring that stock levels are aligned with actual market demand.
